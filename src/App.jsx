                I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                outstanding. it took my learning to the next level in a way that
                no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it
                during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
                certainly helped me land a jov as a full-stack developer after
                receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
